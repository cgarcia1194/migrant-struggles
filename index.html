			<p class="intro"> Since April 2022, more than <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/697-23/as-number-asylum-seekers-city-s-care-tops-60-000-mayor-adams-30-day-notices-for" target="_blank"> 116,000 migrants </a>  have come to New York City. At least three essential aspects of their lives - housing, work, and education for their children - all come with significant challenges. In July, the city began <a href= "https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/28/23893594/migrants-shelters-60-day-clock-expires-new-york-city" target="_blank"> issuing </a> 60-day eviction notices to adult migrants in its shelters. New York City Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-reduces-shelter-stay-limit-to-30-days-for-adult-migrants" target="_blank">  announced </a> in late September that the maximum stay going forward for adult migrants in shelters would be halved, to just 30 days. As for work, migrants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/nyregion/migrant-delivery-unlicensed-moped.html" target="_blank">have flocked</a> to food delivery, as it is perhaps the only way to make a living. This livelihood for migrants has become increasingly fraught, as the NYPD <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/7/23863323/migrant-moped-nypd-raid-tasers" target="_blank"> has cracked down</a> on unregistered mopeds outside of shelters. For their children's schooling, migrants enter a public school system with <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/thousands-of-migrant-students-head-to-school-in-nyc-for-1st-time" target="blank"> limited resources</a> to accommodate so many children who do not yet speak English.
